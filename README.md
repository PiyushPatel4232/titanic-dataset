# 🚢 Titanic Disaster Analysis & Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project dives into the legendary Titanic disaster dataset to explore patterns and predict survival outcomes using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Machine Learning**. From handling missing values to building predictive models, this notebook is a complete step-by-step breakdown of the Titanic dataset.

## 📊 Steps Covered
### **Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Understanding dataset structure & identifying missing values.
- Visualizing survival rates based on **gender, class, family size, and embarkation port**.
- Insights into which features influence survival the most.

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked, Fare).
- Converting categorical features into numeric values.
- Feature engineering (FamilySize, Title extraction, etc.).

### **Step 3: Model Building & Prediction**
- Applied **Logistic Regression** & **Decision Trees** to predict survival.
- Standardized numerical features for better model performance.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## 🔥 Key Learnings
✅ **Feature Engineering Matters** – Extracting meaningful insights from data improves model accuracy.
✅ **Handling Missing Data** – Smart imputation techniques can prevent information loss.
✅ **Visualization is Powerful** – EDA helped in understanding data patterns better.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control & Collaboration)

### **💡 Fun Fact:**
Did you know that 75% of **women survived**, but only 20% of **men** did? Gender played a huge role in survival!
